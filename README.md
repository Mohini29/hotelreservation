# Hotel Reservation

This is a basic implementation of Hotel Reservation Project using Java.


## Getting Started

Imagine you own a hotel with a certain number of identical rooms - let's call this number the size of your hotel. Your clients would like to make reservations for rooms: They e.g. call to check if they can make a reservation for one room from a certain start date start until a certain end date end. For each booking request you will have to check if there is a room available and either conÔ¨Årm the booking or reject it.

  (-4,2)  -  Decline

2: Requests are accepted (Size=3):
  (0,5)  -  Accept   
  (7,13) -  Accept   
  (3,9)  -  Accept   
  (5,7)  -  Accept   
  (6,6)  -  Accept   
  (0,4)  -  Accept   
  
3: Requests are declined (Size=3)  
StartDate EndDate Result:   
  (1,3)  -  Accept   
  (2,5)  -  Accept   
  (1,9)  -  Accept  
  (0,15) -  Decline  
  
4: Requests can be accepted after a decline (Size=3)  
StartDate EndDate Result:  
  (1,3)  -  Accept   
  (0,15) -  Accept  
  (1,9)  -  Accept   
  (2,5)  -  Decline   
  (4,9)  -  Accept  
  
5: Complex Requests (Size=2)  
StartDate EndDate Result:   
  (1,3)  -  Accept   
  (0,4)  -  Accept   
  (2,3)  -  Decline   
  (5,5)  -  Accept
